A client for the Fritzbox API, from version 5.50 and above.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fritzbox'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fritzbox

## Usage

You need to configure the `fritzbox` first:
``` ruby
Fritzbox.configure do |config|
  config.password = 'FRITZBOX_PASSWORD'
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run
```shell
bundle install
```

Then, run
```shell
bundle exec rspec spec
```
to run the tests.
You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

By default it expects a `.env` file looks like, if you want to test it against your fritzbox instance:
```shell
PASSWORD=<FRITZBOX_PASSWORD>
```
However, you can also create different environment files and start the console with it:
```shell
ENV_FILE=.env.test ./bin/console
```
